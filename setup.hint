ldesc: "Vocoders are often used to add a robotic effect to vocals in music.
This vocoder plugin has 2 AUDIO inputs and 1 OUTPUT (of course). The first
INPUT is the 'Formant' signal which is usually someone's voice. The second
INPUT is the 'Carrier' signal which is some sort of continuous synth sound.
The 'Carrier' signal is modulated to the 'Formant'."
